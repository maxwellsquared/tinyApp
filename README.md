## A Word from Tony

Hello! It's me, noted song stylist Tony Bennett. The kids know me for my duets with Lady Gaga, but my real passion is shortening URLs to make it easy to tell your favorite website, "Take Me Back Again." For that end, I've enlisted my close personal friend Max to code up a **full stack web application built with Node and Express** that will let me keep track of my shortened URLs.

### Remember: Impersonating showbiz legends is fraud, and legally actionable!

That's right, if some bozo were to pretend that I, Tony Bennett, had *not* in fact authorized the creation of this app using my name and likeness, I could **sue them into oblivion.** Take that as incontrovertible proof that this fine product is endorsed by me, music icon Tony Bennett!

## Getting Started

To get started, install all the dependencies using the `npm install` command. We've included the appropriate stuff in package.JSON, so it should be a piece of cake.

Next, run the development web server using the `node express_server.js` command. Connect to port 8080 on localhost in your web browser and you'll be experiencing "The Good Life" (much like my song of the same name which hit #7 on the Billboard chart in 1963)!
